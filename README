To make a schooltool development environment, run:
- docker-compose build
- export UID (to configure container schooltool user with the same UID that the current linux user)
- docker-compose up -d
- ssh schooltool@localhost (add your public ssh key to .ssh/authorized_keys if needed)
- In the previously opened ssh console:
  - cd sandbox
  - make
  - cd schooltool.peas (or schooltool.isli or schooltool.rising)
  - make develop
  - make run

You can now visit http://localhost:7080
